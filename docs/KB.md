## Repository state

- Default branch: `main`.
- Verified source revision: `d063600a69dde634b4b9a4d86e3bc534a1611c91`.
- The clean checkout was verified before this documentation change. This index is public-safe repository documentation. It does not prove current local provider state, runtime behavior, release availability, or external service state.

## Product and source facts

- meterusage is a macOS menu-bar app that displays AI coding-assistant quota and usage signals. `README.md` describes provider clusters, quota cards, heatmaps, sparklines, alerts, diagnostics, widgets, and a scriptable JSON CLI.
- The app is Swift Package Manager based, targets macOS 13 or later, and includes an executable target, a widget target, and a test target. `Package.swift` is the source for this package structure.
- Provider data sources are implemented under `Sources/MeterUsage/Services/`. `docs/PRIVACY.md` describes the boundary for local files, provider CLIs, documented network endpoints, and data reduction before display.
- Demo mode uses synthetic data. `README.md` and `docs/DEMO.md` describe it as the path for screenshots and local UI inspection without provider accounts.
- `CHANGELOG.md` records version 0.2.6 as the latest repository release entry, with Codex display and widget changes dated 2026-08-25. This is repository release-note state, not proof of a published release.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` requires focused changes, synthetic fixtures, and `swift build`, `swift test`, and `Scripts/make-app.sh` before a code pull request.

## Verification gaps

- Repository files do not prove current provider authentication, quota freshness, network responses, local machine state, app installation, signed-bundle state, GitHub Release state, or runtime UI behavior.
- Treat cost figures as estimates. `README.md` identifies provider dashboards as the billing source of record.

## Public disclosure boundary

- This KB contains only public repository facts. Do not add private paths, account identifiers, tokens, prompts, source transcripts, internal agent instructions, private repository references, or personal data.
